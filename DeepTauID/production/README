files and config file for production

The samples.cfg file contains a list of samples to be processed. 
Please look at the content of the file for description.

The mass production can be started and monitored by the scripts in the "../scripts"
directory

example:
jobSub.py --file samples_XX.cfg myconfig.py myoutdir

-> submits jobs to the condor batch for mass production. The output root files will NOT be stored in
the output directory specified. Instead, a new directory will be created on the user eos (cernbox).
A symlink will be provided in the output directory <myoutdir>

To check the job status, run:

check.py my_sample

where "my_sample" is a subfolder that was created in the output directory "myoutdir"


The functionality is still very limited. To be extended in future versions.
